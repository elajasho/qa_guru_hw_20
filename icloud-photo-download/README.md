# iCloud Photo Download Example

This sub-project contains a draft JUnit 5 test that demonstrates how
one could automate downloading iCloud Photos in groups of 1000 items
using Selenide. The test is disabled because it requires real iCloud
credentials and manual entry of a two-factor authentication code.
