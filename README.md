This project contains examples of JUnit 5 tests using Selenide and REST Assured.

A new example test `ICloudDownloadTest` shows a rough approach to automate
downloading iCloud Photos in batches of 1000. The test is disabled by default
because it requires real iCloud credentials and manual two-factor
authentication.
